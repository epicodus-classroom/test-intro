## Terminology

* **Array:** A collection of items grouped inside `[]`.
* **Collection:** A computer programming term for a list of items. An array is just one kind of collection.
* **Element:** An item in an array.

## Examples
<hr />

Arrays can have just about anything as elements, even other arrays:

```javascript
["string", 123, true, ["another string", 456], 321, 52 / 3]
```

## Methods

## Tips

**Writing descriptive code:** Use `let` when you plan to modify an array and `const` when the array won't be modified. However, be aware that `const` won't actually stop you from modifying an array!
