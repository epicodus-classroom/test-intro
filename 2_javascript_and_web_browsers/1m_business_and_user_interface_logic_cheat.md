## Terminology
<hr />

* **Business logic**: The code responsible for handling the evaluation and manipulation of data; does not require any user interface.

* **User interface logic**:  The code responsible for the interaction between the user and the application; handles tasks such as event listening, user input forms, DOM manipulation, display and styling. We haven't learned how to write the actual code for this (except via `window` methods), but we will soon!

## Summary
<hr />

Because they are responsible for entirely separate things, code for business logic and user interface logic should always be separated.
