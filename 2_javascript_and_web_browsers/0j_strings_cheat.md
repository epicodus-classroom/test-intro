## Terminology
<hr />

* **String:** a JavaScript data type that represents the exact text of whatever is enclosed in the quotes.

## Examples
<hr />

```javascript
"Strings can contain letters, numbers like 1, 14.5, and 5784329, and characters like @, $, and %."
```

You can assign variables to strings:

```javascript
> const myString = "Strings can contain characters like @, $, and %.";
```

Include quotes in strings by either escaping them with a backslash `\`, or by using single quotes outside:

```javascript
"Quoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"";
"Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.'";
```

You can use either single quotes `' '` or double quotes `" "` around your strings, as long as the start and end quote marks match.

```javascript
'This is a string surrounded by single quotes.';
"This is a string surrounded by double quotes.";
```
