## Terminology
<hr />

**Primitive:** A simple element that can't change. JavaScript has seven types of primitives.

**Immutable:** Something that can't change. All primitives are immutable.

**Object:** A container for data that represents a group of related data. Objects can have multiple pieces of data of any data type. Objects are mutable.

**Mutable:** Something that can change. All objects are immutable.

**Custom:** Something, like an object, that we define — its name, data, and functionality.

**Built-In:** Something, like an object, that is pre-defined in JavaScript source code — its name, data, and functionality.

### Types of Primitives

* **Number:** All numbers such as `221`, `-4`, or `1.97`.

* **BigInt:** A numeric type like number, representing whole numbers (meaning without decimals) that are larger than two to the power of 53: 2^53.

* **Symbol:** A newer primitive that was introduced in 2015 that we won't be covering in the program. Read more about symbols on the [Mozilla documentation on Symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Symbol).

* **String:** A string is a set of characters enclosed in quotations. `"hello"` is an example.

* **Boolean:** A boolean is either `true` or `false`.

* **Null:** Null is nothing.

* **Undefined:** This means something hasn't been defined in our code yet.
