## Terminology
<hr />

* **Function:** A function is a bundle of code that performs a set of procedures.

* **Method:**  A method is a type of function that belongs to a specific data type. It is an action run on a piece of data; you can think of it as a message you send to a piece of data, and the result is the response.

* **Receiver:** The data that the method is called on. In the example below, `toUpperCase` is called on `"hi"` and `"hi"` is the receiver.

```js
> "hi".toUpperCase();
HI
```

* **Return value:**  The return value is the method's response.

* **Argument:**  Some methods take one or more arguments that provide the method with additional information to help it perform its action.

* **Parens:** A shorthand for saying parentheses.

* **Calling a method:** This means that we are executing a method's  actions. We must include parentheses at the end of a method name to call a method. Here's an example method call:

```js
// calling the toUpperCase method
"hello".toUpperCase()
```
