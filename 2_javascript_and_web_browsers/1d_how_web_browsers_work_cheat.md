## Terminology

---

Web browsers provide the tools that web developers can learn to use to make their own websites interactive. These browser tools are separate from the JavaScript language, but we do use JavaScript to interact with them.

* **The `window` object** represents our current browsing context: either the window or tab we are opened to, including the website we are on. We can learn to access and use `window` properties to manipulate and interact with our browser windows.

* The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is an interactive representation of our HTML document (the HTML source code). The DOM is a hierarchical tree (data structure) that is made up of nodes. Nodes can be of any value, and at its most basic, a node is just a location of data on the tree. In the HTML DOM, the values of every node is an object (different types of objects, but all objects) representing an HTML element, text, or  attribute. 

* **The `document` object** represents the HTML Document Object Model. The DOM is used to represent our HTML document (source code) in the form of a series of hierarchical nested objects (a tree). 

* The `window` and `document` variables are global, which means they are always available.

* An **event** in computer programming is any occurrence that a program can recognize and react to, like a mouse click or a form submission. Events belong to specific browser structures, like the `window` object and `document` object. In other words, there are browser window events, and there are HTML document events.
