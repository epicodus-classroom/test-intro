## Terminology
<hr />

* `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` are called **operators**. An operator is a special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed.

* `0 / 0;` returns `NaN`, which stands for *not a number*. `NaN` is a type of number.

* `Infinity` is also a number.

* **Semicolons**: We use semicolons at the end of many lines in JavaScript. We'll cover this more in future lessons.

## Examples
<hr />

Basic arithmetic works just like you'd expect:

```javascript
1 + 2;
4 - 3;
5 * 6;
9 / 2;
7 + 8 * 9;
(7 + 8) * 9;
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Here are the keyboard shortcuts to open the Chrome DevTools console:

* Windows: 
  * `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `j`
