## Terminology
<hr />

* **Boolean**: `true` and `false` are booleans. They are not strings â€” they simply represent being true or false.

* **Assignment operator**:  Changes the value of the variable on the left of the operator.

* **Comparison/relational operator**:  Does not change any values, but returns a boolean (`true` or `false`) depending on whether the statement evaluates as true or false.

## Commonly-Used Operators
<hr />

**Be aware of the difference between the `=` assignment operator and the `===` comparison operator.**

* `+=` increase value of variable on left of operator by value on right of operator
* `-=` decrease value of variable on left of operator by value on right of operator
* `*=` multiply value of variable on left of operator by value on right of operator
* `/=` divide value of variable on left of operator by value on right of operator

### Comparison Operators

* `===` is equal to
* `!==` is _not_ equal to
* `>` is greater than
* `>=` is greater than or equal to
