## Terminology

* The DOM, the `window` object, the `document` object, and events are a part of the structures and tools that web browsers make available to web developers. We call this collection of structures and tools **Web APIs**.
* **API** is the acronym for **application programming interface**. An API is a set of code that let's us interact with more complex software in a simplified and pre-defined way. 
  * We use interfaces all of the time. Consider a door knob â€” the knob is the interface that we interact with that handles abstracting the complex internal hardware of the door latch. When we use the door knob, we're triggering the door hardware to do its thing to open the door latch. We don't need to concern ourselves with how the door latch works, we just need to know how to use the door knob.
  * The acronym "API" specifically means that the interface we're working with is for programming applications, and it does the job of letting our program (that we create) talk to another program (for example, the web browser). 
* **Web APIs** are a collection of many APIs that are specifically made for accessing web technologies, like our browser window or our HTML document displayed in our browser window. These APIs are written in JavaScript, and we can use JavaScript to access them, but they are not a part of the JavaScript language.
* Web APIs are made up of **specifications** that describe in detail what each individual API is and does, and **interfaces**, which are different types of objects (with properties and methods) that make up the actual functionality of Web APIs. 
  * An example specification is the DOM, and an example interface is the `document` object.
  * While all Web API interfaces are objects, not all objects are interfaces. An object is a data type, often defined as a collection of properties. An interface is a special kind of object that exposes (makes available for use) the functionality of an API.

**In regards to using the new technical terminology covered in this lesson, you can:**

* Refer to the `window` and `document` interfaces as "objects" or "interfaces". Going forward in the lessons, we'll refer to them as "objects".
