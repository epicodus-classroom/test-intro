## Pausing on Exceptions
<hr />

* You can turn on the "pause on exceptions" debugging feature by clicking on the **Sources** tab within the DevTools, and then clicking the button on the top right that looks like an octagon with a pause button. (The octagon will turn blue after you click it.) Do not check the checkbox that reads "Pause on caught exceptions" below the octagon.

* You can change the position of the DevTools dock by clicking the three vertical dots in the upper right corner and clicking the _Dock side_ icon of your choice.

* Pausing on exceptions pauses the code whenever an exception is thrown. This can help us find errors in our code.

* A call stack traces where an error comes from. We can see the call stack of an exception below the "Pause on caught exceptions" option.

* You can resume execution of code by clicking on the arrow that looks like the "play" symbol (like for VCRs or YouTube videos). 

* You should use the _Pause on Exception_ feature of the DevTools' debugger when you test out your website.
