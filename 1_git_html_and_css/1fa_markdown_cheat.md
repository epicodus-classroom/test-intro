## Headings 

---

Headings are designated with a `#`.  Text with 1 `#` is the largest and text with 6 `#`s is the smallest.

```
# Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
## Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
### Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
#### Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
##### Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
###### Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
```

becomes

# Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
## Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
### Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
#### Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
##### Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
###### Best Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Italics 

---

To create italics, surround the text with single underscores `_`. 

**Example:**  
` _Be warned_, these will fly off of the plate!` 

becomes:

 _Be warned_, these will fly off the plate!

## Bold

---

To create a bold text, surround the text with double asterisks `**. 

**Example:** 
`Bake for **10 minutes** or until golden brown.`  

becomes:

Bake for **10 minutes** or until golden brown.

## Ordered lists (numbered) 

---

Ordered list just use the number and period for each line.

```
1. Beat the butter...
2. Mix the flour...
```

## Unordered lists (bullet points)

---

Bullet points are made with the `*` and a single space.  There must also be a blank line before the first item on the list.

**Example:** 

```
Ingredients

* butter
* flour
* brown sugar
* maple syrup
```

becomes:

Ingredients

* butter
* flour
* brown sugar
* maple syrup

## Links

---

Two elements make up a Markdown link, the text that will display on the page surrounded by `[]` and the web address where the link will go surrounded by `()`. 

**Example:** `[Click here](http://allrecipes.com/) to check out my other great recipes.`  

## Images 

---

Like links except the square brackets are preceded by `!` and contain _alt text_ for the visually impaired, and the `()` can contain a web address for an image. 

**Example:** `![An image of a cookie](http://lorempixel.com/400/200/)`
