Welcome to your first day of Epicodus! We'll be covering a lot of information today and it's easy to get overwhelmed — especially if you are having any challenges getting remote tools to work due to issues with your personal computer or the internet.

In this lesson, we'll cover today's schedule and expectations so you know exactly what to focus on — and where you should be by the end of the day. This is _only_ an overview of events and there are upcoming lessons with more detailed information and instructions.

## Schedule

---

**Please keep in mind that times are approximate** — for instance, orientation could take a little longer or a little less time depending on factors such as questions from students. 

**8:00 – 9:00: Orientation Part 1**

First, all students will take part in an orientation. This orientation will be held on campus or using Google Meet, depending on which program you are signed up for. You will receive an email before class begins with an invitation to the orientation.

Note that you will need to be individually let into the video meeting by Epicodus staff. This typically starts at 8 am and can take some time. So, if you are not able to join the video meeting right away, this is why. Please be patient as Epicodus staff work to let everyone into the meeting and get started.

**9:00: Find Dev Team**

After orientation is over, your instructor will share dev team assignments and you will group up with the members of your preassigned dev team on Discord or on campus. In every course section, you will be part of a dev team. If you are having any issues with members of your dev team, please reach out to an instructor.

**9:00 – 9:30: Dev Team Scrum**

**Dev Team Scrum** happens every day. Generally, it's an opportunity to discuss technical issues you might be facing, things you've learned, and anything you might be excited or frustrated about. Today, it's an opportunity to get to know your fellow students a little better. Your instructor will let you know where you should group up, whether on campus or on Discord.  

Once you've found your dev team you'll take part in an icebreaker during Scrum. Information about Dev Team Scrum meetings and the icebreaker you will do is in the next lesson about the [Dev Team Scrum](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/dev-team-scrum).

After the dev team icebreaker, the next step is to find a pair from within your Dev Team and continue on to the VS Code Live Share Icebreaker. If there is an odd number of people in your dev team, there will be one group of three. 

**For online students, Dev Team Scrum will also include a connectivity debugging session to make sure that everyone is able to connect:**

*  Your first step is to connect to the voice channel for your dev team. When you are in the voice channel, you will have the option to video chat. We ask that you video chat unless you are having internet bandwidth or other difficulties that prevent you from doing so. 
*  The next step is to check in with other members of your dev team to make sure that they've connected to the Dev Team Scrum channel as well. If not, try to help other members of your team troubleshoot any connectivity issues. You will likely deal with remote connectivity issues at least occasionally during the program, whether it involves your set up or your pair's. If anything comes up, this is a good time to practice! Troubleshooting technical issues beyond code is a huge part of being part of a programmer so take the time to help everyone get connected first.

If you need help with troubleshooting connectivity issues, please reach out to your instructor.

**9:30 – 10:00: VS Code Live Share Icebreaker**

Next, you'll do an icebreaker exercise with your pair through VS Code Live Share. This exercise has multiple purposes — first, it's an icebreaker and a good way to learn about a fellow student on your first day of Epicodus. It's also an exercise to practice using VS Code Live Share and to establish good pairing habits right away.

**10:00 – 12:00: Morning Pair Programming**

You'll pair with one other person from your dev team and start learning coding concepts. You might get started a little earlier or a little later. It's your first day so don't worry about getting ahead or falling behind. Being a student at Epicodus is a marathon, not a sprint, and many concepts that may seem very confusing at first will become second nature over time as you get continued practice. Make sure to regularly take breaks.

**12:00 – 1:00: Lunch**

**1:00 – 4:00: Pair Programming**

**4:00 – 5:00: Orientation Part 2**

Epicodus staff will cover other important orientation topics at the end of the day.

## First Day Expectations

---

By the end of the day, you should've attended both orientations and worked with your dev team and with your pair on debugging connectivity issues as needed. Hopefully you'll also have a productive day of pair programming, though occasionally students do have major issues with remote connectivity. If you do have major connectivity issues, keep in mind that we will be working with each other to resolve technical issues throughout this section. Starting at Epicodus is a big transition — so be patient with yourself. You will get a lot of practice with technical and coding issues as an Epicodus student and in your future career — that is a huge part of being a coder.

We'll be covering the following key coding concepts today. **These concepts will all be required for this section's independent project.** Indeed, they are concepts you'll be using throughout the program. Don't worry if all these concepts aren't clear today — you'll be practicing them over and over not just in this course section but throughout your time at Epicodus.

We cover the following concepts in the pre-work, and practice them more today:

* Using the command line to create, move and delete directories and files
* Using the command line to navigate through your files

The following are brand-new concepts that you'll get lots of opportunity to practice further:

* Setting up Git in a project
* Tracking changes with Git
* Using Git in the command line
* HTML
* HTML indentation and spacing
* HTML block elements

You will need to be able to use all of the above concepts for this section's independent project — and for future independent projects as well.

You'll also read through your first DEI lesson as homework tonight: [Homework: Social Identities](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/homework-social-identities).

**Take note:** on short weeks, daily expectations change, and you may cover more or less content on a given class day.
