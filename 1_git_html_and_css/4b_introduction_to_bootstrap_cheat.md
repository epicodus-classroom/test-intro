## Terminology
<hr />

* **Front-End**:  The portion of a website or application that is in the browser.

* **Back-End**: Code that serves data or manages a database that cannot be accessed by a user.

* **Framework:** A foundation of pre-built tools, software, code, and other resources we can use to create a project more easily than if we created it from scratch.

**Library.** A library is a smaller set of pre-defined code that we can download and use in our apps. It is quite similar to a framework, though frameworks are always larger and often comprise multiple libraries and other tooling.

**Toolkit.** A toolkit is a set of pre-built tools used for a particular purpose. Often, a toolkit is defined as multiple and related libraries, packaged into one. Usually, frameworks are much larger than toolkits, and a toolkit is larger than a library. 

* **Front-End Frameworks:** Pre-built code that assists us in creating an application that runs in the browser.

* **Bootstrap**: One of the most widely-used free front-end frameworks.
