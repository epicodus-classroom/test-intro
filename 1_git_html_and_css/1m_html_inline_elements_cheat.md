Some inline elements:

 * `<strong>`:  Makes text appear bolder. Example: `<strong>`**This content is important.**`</strong>`

 * `<em>`:  Emphasizes text. Similar to italics. Example:  `<em>`_This content is emphasized._`</em>`

 * `<a>`:  Anchor tag. Creates a link. The URL following `href` denotes where the link should travel to.  Example:  `<a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>` — link to another web page
