## Summary
<hr />

* In HTML, the beginning and ending tags of an element on multiple lines should always be left-aligned. For example, when you see `<html lang="en-US">`, you should be able to visually scan the page straight down to find its closing tag (the same for `<head>` and `<body>`).  One way to implement this is to create opening and closing tags at the same time and then add the contents.
