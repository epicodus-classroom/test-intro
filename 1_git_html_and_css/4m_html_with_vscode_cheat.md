## Overview

* We can use VS Code features to make writing and working with HTML easier.

### Folding Code

We can fold code by hovering over the gutter between the line numbers and the code. This will show arrows for each section of code. We can click on the arrows to either expand or hide our code. 

### Using Line Guides and Highlighting Divs

We can click a div to highlight it. When we do, the closing div will also automatically be highlighted and the vertical guide for that div will be emphasized.

### Intellisense

Intellisense can help us auto-fill code. If Intellisense isn't automatically triggered, we can prompt it to do so by hitting `Ctrl` + `Space`.

We can use what an option from the dropdown that Intellisense provides and hit _Tab_ to auto-fill a code snippet.

We can also use Emmet snippets to make auto-filling code even easier. For instance, we can use `li*3` to auto-fill three list items.
