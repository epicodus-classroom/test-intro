Students who are enrolled in our full-stack programs will brainstorm, plan, and complete a final capstone project in 40 hours of dedicated class time during the final course of the program. The capstone project coincides with the React course. The goal of the capstone is to create a portfolio-ready project which you'll be able to add to your resume, share with potential employers, and show off to friends and family!

Listed below is an outline of capstone-related events that occur in the React course. The bolded titles below correspond to the names of each learning section within the React course.

* **Functional Programming:** Begin brainstorming ideas, [learn about deadlines and resources](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/functional-programming-with-javascript/capstone-timeline-deadlines-and-brainstorming-homework), and review the [MVP](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/functional-programming-with-javascript/capstone-planning-the-minimum-viable-product) (Minimum Viable Product).

* **React Fundamentals:** Narrow down your ideas for your capstone, and learn about the [capstone sign-up and proposal](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/react-fundamentals/independent-capstone-project-sign-up-and-proposal) that you will complete during the React with Redux course section.

* **React with Redux:** Share your capstone idea on a public "capstone sign-up" board (shared within your cohort). Then, your normally scheduled time to complete an independent coding project will be spent working on your capstone. As part of your first work session on your capstone, you will complete and turn in your capstone proposal. Your instructors will review your proposal and give feedback as needed.

* **React with NoSQL:** Your normally scheduled time to complete an independent coding project will be spent working on your capstone project.

* **React with APIs:** Your normally scheduled time to complete an independent coding project will be spent working on your capstone project.

* **Independent Capstone:** You will spend this entire course section working on your capstone. On the last day of class, you will present your capstone project to classmates and then turn it in as your final independent coding project.
